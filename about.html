                A tool designed to simplify the creation of high-quality image
                markers for augmented reality applications.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finding suitable images with good tracking performance for
                marker-based AR/MR projects can be time-consuming and
                challenging. Images need to have high contrast, a high feature
                count, and a homogeneous feature distribution to ensure reliable
                tracking.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2023, during my master's thesis on Augmented Reality Task
                Assistance in Life Science Laboratories, while developing an AR
                application for the HoloLens 2 using the
                <a
                  href="https://developer.vuforia.com/library/objects/image-targets"
                  >Vuforia SDK's Image Target</a
                >
                feature, I encountered this very problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately, I came across a
                <a
                  href="https://www.dariomazzanti.com/uncategorized/ar-image-target-generation-vuforia/"
                  >blog post by Dario Mazzanti from 2014</a
                >, which provided a Processing sketch to generate markers
                meeting all these requirements. With some tweaking, I was able
                to create a marker that matched my desired aspect ratio and
                incorporated my product colors.
              </p>

              <p>
                While this code was helpful, I had to spend time understanding
                the marker generation algorithm and how to tweak it.
                Additionally, I needed to download and install
                <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> and re-run the
                program every time I wanted to generate and save a single
                marker. This process was cumbersome and time-consuming.
              </p>

              <p>
                This experience inspired me to develop this AR Image Target
                Generator, making marker generation and customization easily
                accessible. Whether you're working on quick prototypes or larger
                projects requiring multiple markers across various scenes, this
                tool helps you create high-quality image targets effortlessly.
                You can customize markers with random colors or align them with
                your brand identity using your specific product colors—all
                without needing to get into code or graphic design programs.
              </p>

              <p class="uk-text-lead">A quick how-to guide:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Set the pixel size of the longest image edge. (Height or
                  Width)‚
                </li>
                <li>
                  Choose the aspect ratio of your markers. (1:1, 4:3, 16:9)
                </li>
                <li>Choose the border-style. (None, Black, White)</li>
                <li>
                  Choose between three grpahic styles (Mazzanti, Chaos, Dot
                  Matrix)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Choose a background color. (Black or white, only relevant for
                  Chaos and Dot Matrix style)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Randomize the colors or use your own colors for the marker.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the results section, you can see the number of features
                detected in the generated marker using the
                <a
                  href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d1/d89/tutorial_py_orb.html"
                  >OpenCV ORB</a
                >
                algorithm. This metric provides an estimate of the marker's
                quality and tracking performance, allowing you to effectively
                compare different generated markers.
              </p>

              <p>
                I would like to express my gratitude to Dario Mazzanti for
                sharing his insightful blog post and Processing sketch with the
                public. His work enabled me to conduct my AR research and
                significantly influenced the creation of this tool. In honor of
                his contribution, the "Mazzanti" style option in this generator
                is named after him, as its implementation incorporates elements
                of his original Processing sketch.
